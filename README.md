# Home Server

Notes, tips, tricks, cheat sheets, designs, layouts, tools, plans, etc. for my home server. Currently, this is `whiplash`.

## General File System

### Ideal

Stored off-site, but server is a local write-through cache which also updates as external systems update the off-site source. A pull + push cache. Cache is "smart", with more frequently accessed stuff, and _then_ recently accessed stuff, is cached with a higher priority than less-frequently and less-recently accesed stuff.
